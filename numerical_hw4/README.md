# Question 4.11 in Jackson

All that needs to be run is the `4_11.py` script.

For air, I linearly interpolated the given temperatures and pressures
to the necessary values provided in Jackson. The results are very good
and the Clausious-Mossotti and Cruder relations seem to be very
accurate for the provided values.

For pentane, the Clausius-Mossotti relation performs slightly better
than the Cruder relation.

# Relaxation algorithm for polarizable cylinder

To run the polarizable cylinder relaxation algorithm, all that needs
to be executed is the `relaxation_technique_polarizable_cylinder.py`
script. This code does not work for negative epsilon values.
